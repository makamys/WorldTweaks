# WorldTweaks
This mod lets you tweak and disable various parts of vanilla and BoP worldgen. There are options that let you:
* Disable villages
* Change mineshaft generation probability
* Disable cave spider room generation in mineshafts
* Disable dungeon generation
* Use noise-based distribution for tree generation (similarly to Beta 1.7.3)
* Tweak some BoP parameters:
  * Disable mud, quicksand, and poison ivy generation
  * Multiply the amount of BoP foliage per chunk by a value

All options are disabled by default.
